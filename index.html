              <p>
              My name is James, I live in Denver, CO. I am a young entrepreneur with expertise in professional coaching, 
              product development, and management. I am always looking for the next big thing and open to new ventures. Im
              currently working at galvanize as the manager of career services, overseeing two programs across five campuses. 
              I have passions for helping others and I find my work extremely rewarding, yet stressful at times. I've tried my hand at
              the start-up world and have been with a number of teams. Some big, some small, some made an exit, some went bankrupt, and 
              so on. In my spare time you can usually find me at a local meetup, learning a new tutorial, or hacking on some 
              IoT hardware. Some fun projects I'm currently involved in would include designing snowboardsfor Desolation 
              Outdoors, Google Glass & Google Fi beta testing, a craft beer network, and a few others that I need to keep 
              'under wraps'.

            <p>
              I am always looking to collaborate on projects involving graphic design, web / mobile development, alt coin 
              mining pools, and new business ventures of just about any kind. <br>
