              Name's James...
            </h2>
            <p>
              My name is James (www.namesjames.com), I live in Denver, CO. I am a creative businessman with passions for design, 
              entrepreneurship and ecommerce. I am always looking for the next big thing and open to new ventures. Im mainly 
              involved in front end design, digital marketing (seo, ppc, social media, organic directories, blogging), and 
              cryptocurrency mining / trading. I co-founded Deal Industrial a surplus ecommerce marketplace back in 2009. 
              Since then I've started and currently contribute to the following companies: Young Disruption, NiewView, 
              Hire Higher, and CheapCheep. In my spare time you can usually find me completing a freelance project or trying 
              to launch one of the many start-ups I'm a part of. Some fun extra-curricular projects I'm currently involved in 
              would include designing snowboards for Desolation Outdoors, Google Glass beta testing, a craft beer network, and 
              a few others that I need to keep 'under wraps'.

            </div>
            <p>
              I am always looking to collaborate on projects involving graphic design, web / mobile development, alt coin 
              mining pools, and new business ventures of any kind. <br>
